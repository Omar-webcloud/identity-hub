# Identity Hub

A modern, lightweight identity management hub — a web-based interface for handling authentication workflows, user sessions, and identity-related utilities.

This project provides a clean and customizable UI to manage identity flows and serves as a foundation for building secure authentication experiences.



## 📦 Technologies

The project is built using:

- **HTML** — Structure of pages
- **CSS** — Custom styling and responsive layout
- **JavaScript** — Client-side interactions and dynamic behavior

## 📁 Repository Structure

The core files include:

```

/assets/      # Static images, icons, fonts
/css/         # Stylesheets
/fonts/       # Custom fonts used by the UI
/index.html   # Main entry page
/script.js    # UI interactions

````

##  Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omar-webcloud/identity-hub.git
cd identity-hub
````

### Open in your browser

Since this is a static UI project, you can simply open:

```
index.html
```

in any modern web browser.

### Optional: Serve with a Simple HTTP Server

For a smoother development experience (live reload, API proxying, etc.) you can use a local server:

**Using Node**

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server .
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` (or the port shown).
